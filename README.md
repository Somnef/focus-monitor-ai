# Inspiration
Losing focus and spending multiple unproductive hours in front of our screens trying to get the job done is frustrating.
\
```["students", "freelancers", "researchers", "workers"]``` we all share this struggle.
  
We aim to use AI to initiate the solving of this daily-life issue.

# What it does 
* detects the posture of the user
* tracks the eyes of the user
* recognize the spatial orientation of the user's head
* calculate and monitor the focus index of the user over time

# How we built it
Using AI and machine learning techniques we are able to detect the posture of the user in front of the screen, from that we monitor the focus state of the user.

# Challenges we ran into
* real time stream of data
* time constraints

# Accomplishments that we're proud of
* implemented a working AI (machine learning) system for focus tracking and productivity optimization.
* next winners.

# What we learned
* team-spirit and to collaborate with each other.
* to work under pressure
* sleeping is important

# What's next for Monitoring focus and productivity.
we aim to add more features to our work, such as :

* Voice assistant - It can be integrated in the project to facilitate user experience.

* Schedule manager - Using Machine learning algorithms to analyse trends and habits in the user’s productivity, we will be able to suggest an optimal schedule that ensure getting the most out of the user’s potential.

* Chatbot - for more interactivity.

# Built With

`python` `Mediapipe` `opencv`
